# Data Analysis: The Movie Database Project
### Using the pandas library in python to analyse The Movie Database (TMDB) data, focusing on markdown and design.
In this solo project, I was asked to use data from TMDB to perform exploratory data analysis and draw insights aimed at inspiring a stakeholder wishing to seek new ways to provide movie recommendations to customers. <br>
There were some minimum requirements for completion:
- Three python visualisations.
- Two significant key points drawn from the data.
- Analysis on two different movies based on what we found.

This project was performed almost entirely using the pandas library, while any visualisations were made using matplotlib and seaborn. Before analysis, there was required preliminary data cleaning that is clearly laid out and explained in the project. The biggest challenge related to how some of the data was entered into the table as dictionaries, despite python registering them as objects. Once cleaned, any avenue of interest could be explored as long as it met the minimum requirements.
