A solo data analysis project used to assess the work done during my Digital Futures Programmatic Data Wrangling module.
I was tasked to perform exploratory data analysis and draw insights from The Movie Database (TMDB) which contained data on over 4000 movies with features such as title, release date, movie length etc.
The Project required data cleaning that is clearly laid out in the project.
The requirements for the project were 3 python visualisations, 2 significant key points from the data, and analysis on 2 specific movies based on what we found.
